Multi-source Manifold Feature Transfer Learning




# Running the code
Due to the limitation of upload file size and total capacity, we only upload MI2 and RSVP datasets. 
The rest datasets used in our experiment can be downloaded here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FG1pDzFlW8b596MUIdXP3g.  Extraction code：MMFT .



Run these demo files in MATLAB could show the performance similar(should be consistent) to the results in our paper. 
demo_MI    :  Obtain the classification results of MI1-MI4 datasets.
demo_RSVP  :  Obtain the classification results of RSVP dataset.
demo_ERN   :  Obtain the classification results of ERN dataset.

Run these files in MATLAB could show the performance similar(should be consistent) to the results in our paper. 
Domain_selection_MI   ： Obtain the domian selection results to MI1-MI4.
